Welcome hackers!

This project accepts and *encourages* contributions. If you would like to get 
involved you can join us on our mailing list and discussion rooms. More 
information on these at http://prosody.im/discuss

Patches are welcome, though before sending we would appreciate if you read 
docs/coding_style.txt for guidelines on how to format your code, and are 
comfortable with copyright of contributions being assigned to the core 
developers.
