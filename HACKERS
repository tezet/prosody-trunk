Welcome hackers!

This project accepts and *encourages* contributions. If you would like to get involved you can join us on our mailing list at: <doh, we need a mailing list>

You can also find us in the chatroom at lxmppd@conference.heavy-horse.co.uk

Patches are welcome, though before sending we would appreciate if you read docs/coding_style.txt for guidelines on how to format your code.
